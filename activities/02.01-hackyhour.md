## Hacky Hour 

Hacky Hours are informal, regularly scheduled meetups where researchers can bring research IT-related issues for discussion or help.

These might include issues with Python, R, HPC, statistics, Matlab or other software.

They are generally volunteer-run, and aim to build referral networks and communities of practice around research software and skills.
