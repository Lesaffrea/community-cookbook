### Research Bazaar (ResBaz)

ResBaz is a 3-day research festival to teach skills and help people build local communities. It generally encompasses workshops such
as Software and Data Carpentry workshops, along with a range of talks, games, poster and networking sessions such as the Knowledge Bazaar.

ResBaz was first run in Melbourne in 2015. The model quickly became popular, and ResBaz events were run in ten cities worldwide in 2016
and in 14 locations in 2017. Planning for [ResBaz 2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/) is already underway.

# Help Sessions

## Hacky Hour 

Hacky Hours are informal, regularly scheduled meetups where researchers can bring research IT-related issues for discussion or help.

These might include issues with Python, R, HPC, statistics, Matlab or other software.

They are generally volunteer-run, and aim to build referral networks and communities of practice around research software and skills.

### CarpentryCon

CarpentryCon is the key community building and networking event in the Carpentries' annual calendar.

The 2018 CarpentryCon will be held from 30 May - 1 June at University College, Dublin.

The theme of CarpentryCon 2018 is *Building Locally, Connecting Globally*.

#### Purpose and Scope of CarpentryCon

- **Community Building:** bring together members of the Carpentry community, including instructors, partners, advocates, and staff, together with people sharing similar interests from around the globe. We will have a “come and learn” format that is different from most conferences.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** The event will include sessions on teaching methods, curriculum development, community organization, and leadership skills. (As noted in the preamble, the final list of sessions will be determined by the program committee in consultation with the community, balancing “who wants to learn what?” with “who’s willing to teach what?”.)
- **Networking:** Opportunities will be provided for participants to come together informally to share stories about challenges and successes.
- **Contributed talks/posters:** There will be at least one session where attendees can share how they have incorporated Carpentry techniques into their own research and teaching, and/or how they have grown their local Carpentry community. This is crucial as presenting will be a requirement if attendees are seeking travel support from their home institution.

#### The CarpentryCon Task Force

The [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/TaskForces/2018-CarpentryCon) has been created within the carpentries to help organize and coordinate the CarpentryCon 2018.

#### What members of the task force do

Right now, we are working on

- drafting the CarpentryCon program
- recruiting local and global participants to help organize and promote the event
- getting feedback and estimating the attendance
- seeking sponsorship

All progress on above items is reported within the [CarpentryCon repo](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon).
