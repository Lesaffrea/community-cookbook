# Help Sessions

There are various types of help sessions that have been created at many of The Carpentries member institutions. The common theme is to develop a regularlly scheduled and frequent event where peopple can come together and support each other with their technical challenges. These are called things like Hacky Hour, PhTea, Code and Pizza, or Office Hours. These kinds of events can be slow to get started, with it taking months to develop a steady cohort of regulars. It is helpful to think about the initial anchoring experts in various areas that would be helpful to have around. Examples include a GIS librarian, technical support staff, and senior graduate students. Mature community help sessions become as useful to the so-called experts as they are for the novice and intermediate researchers. Having them in an informal setting with the ability to order food/beer at your own expense is also popular. In other cases a budget for pizza and/or snacks is requested to provide extra enticement.
