# Vendor Training

If you have researchers that are using a particular vendor tool, sensor or aparatus, it is often possible to bring that vendor in for local on-site training. Depending on the vendor this can be a costly per-seat workshop, or it can be done for free. It is also possible to work to build a relationship with the vendor so they're able to see how their training might lead to future sales or a continued use of their products. In this section we'll share some thoughs and ideas on vendor supplied trainings that can be useful to build into your local community. Vendors are working to stay in business, and your ability as a resarcher to use their complex tools and systems is an important part of how you're able to be capable. By working together to seek high-quality and relevant training from the key vendors supporting academic research, we can work together to make these trainings impactful and useful for our local communities.
