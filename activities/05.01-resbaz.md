### Research Bazaar (ResBaz)

ResBaz is a 3-day research festival to teach skills and help people build local communities. It generally encompasses workshops such
as Software and Data Carpentry workshops, along with a range of talks, games, poster and networking sessions such as the Knowledge Bazaar.

ResBaz was first run in Melbourne in 2015. The model quickly became popular, and ResBaz events were run in ten cities worldwide in 2016
and in 14 locations in 2017. Planning for [ResBaz 2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/) is already underway.
