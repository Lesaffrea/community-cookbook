# Skills Workshops

Short format workshops, over a number of days can be a great way to bring people together to share skills. For workshops to be most impactful it is important to use quality lessons and have prepared instructors. The Carpentries supports and mentors a global community of instructors and lessons they can teach.  


## Software Carpentry

Overview of Software Carpentry workshops

### Lessons

Software Carpentry maintains lessons in the Unix Shell, Git, R, Python, SQL, Make and Mercurial. Software Carpentry lessons focus on teaching tools in a discipline agnostic way, in order to help researchers from all disciplines develop skill with the tool. Software Carpentry lessons aren't meant to be exhaustive and comprehensive enumerations of all possible features of a particular too. Instead the lessons seek to strike a balance of reducing cognitive load, while empowering the researcher to have a better understanding of how the tool could be used in their workflow.

# Help Sessions

There are various types of help sessions that have been created at many of The Carpentries member institutions. The common theme is to develop a regularly scheduled and frequent event where people can come together and support each other with their technical challenges. These are called things like Hacky Hour, PhTea, Code and Pizza, or Office Hours. These kinds of events can be slow to get started, with it taking months to develop a steady cohort of regulars. It is helpful to think about the initial anchoring experts in various areas that would be helpful to have around. Examples include a GIS librarian, technical support staff, and senior graduate students. Mature community help sessions become as useful to the so-called experts as they are for the novice and intermediate researchers. Having them in an informal setting with the ability to order food/beer at your own expense is also popular. In other cases, a budget for pizza and/or snacks is requested to provide extra enticement.
## Hacky Hour

Hacky Hours are informal, regularly scheduled meetups where researchers can bring research IT-related issues for discussion or help.

These might include issues with Python, R, HPC, statistics, Matlab or other software.

They are generally volunteer-run, and aim to build referral networks and communities of practice around research software and skills.

# Events

There are various kinds of annual/semi-annual events you can run to give your community a focused opportunity to share and plan more intensely with each other, and to invite new members into the community. Within The Carpentries campus communities, ResBaz (Research Bazaar) is a popular multi-day event to share research software tools and how to use them. These events are as much about training and skills as they are about networking and ideas. There are many types of un-conference and satellite conference that can be exciting to bring to your organization. These include events like OpenCon-local, THATCamp and more. Planning one of these local satellite events can be a great way to bring people together on your campus. Additionally, there are several events in the Carpentries community that draw Carpentries instructors. We have an etherpad where we share among the instructor community what conferences we'll be attending. In the cookbook we'll list some marquee events that bring many Carpentries community members together.
# Research Bazaar (ResBaz)

ResBaz is a 3-day research festival to teach skills and help people build local communities. It generally encompasses workshops such
as Software and Data Carpentry workshops, along with a range of talks, games, poster and networking sessions such as the Knowledge Bazaar.

ResBaz was first run in Melbourne in 2015. The model quickly became popular, and ResBaz events were run in ten cities worldwide in 2016
and in 14 locations in 2017. Planning for [ResBaz 2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/) is already underway.

# CarpentryCon

CarpentryCon is the key community building and networking event in the Carpentries' annual calendar.

The inaugural 2018 CarpentryCon will be held from 30 May - 1 June at University College, Dublin.

The theme of CarpentryCon 2018 is *Building Locally, Connecting Globally*.

## Purpose and Scope of CarpentryCon

- **Community Building:** bring together members of the Carpentry community, including instructors, partners, advocates, and staff, together with people sharing similar interests from around the globe. We will have a “come and learn” format that is different from most conferences.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** The event will include sessions on teaching methods, curriculum development, community organization, and leadership skills. (As noted in the preamble, the final list of sessions will be determined by the program committee in consultation with the community, balancing “who wants to learn what?” with “who’s willing to teach what?”.)
- **Networking:** Opportunities will be provided for participants to come together informally to share stories about challenges and successes.
- **Contributed talks/posters:** There will be at least one session where attendees can share how they have incorporated Carpentry techniques into their own research and teaching, and/or how they have grown their local Carpentry community. This is crucial as presenting will be a requirement if attendees are seeking travel support from their home institution.

## The CarpentryCon Task Force

The [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/tree/master/TaskForces/2018-CarpentryCon) has been created within the carpentries to help organize and coordinate the CarpentryCon 2018.

## What members of the task force do

Right now, we are working on

- drafting the CarpentryCon program
- recruiting local and global participants to help organize and promote the event
- getting feedback and estimating the attendance
- seeking sponsorship

All progress on above items is reported within the [CarpentryCon repo](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon).

# Vendor Training

If you have researchers that are using a particular vendor tool, sensor or apparatus, it is often possible to bring that vendor in for local on-site training. Depending on the vendor this can be a costly per-seat workshop, or it can be done for free. It is also possible to work to build a relationship with the vendor so they're able to see how their training might lead to future sales or a continued use of their products. In this section we'll share some thoughts and ideas on vendor supplied trainings that can be useful to build into your local community. Vendors are working to stay in business, and your ability as a researcher to use their complex tools and systems is an important part of how you're able to be capable. By working together to seek high-quality and relevant training from the key vendors supporting academic research, we can work together to make these trainings impactful and useful for our local communities.
