## Introduction

Welcome to the Carpentries' Community Cookbook!

The aim of this repository is to provide a place to gather together links, background, and personal stories about a range of community building tools. We want this to be a collaborative space. We aim to provide 'recipes' to allow you to create your own strong, local communities based on the local 'ingredients' you have to hand. Every town, every country is different, so there is no single 'right' way to create a local community from scratch. However, the ideas gathered here should provide some 'recipes' for you to try, knowing that these have been tested in other people's 'kitchens'. But you will add the local 'flavour' that makes your own community unique.

### Events and resources that help build community include 

- **HackyHours** - informal drop in sessions (usually in a coffee shop or bar) for people to network, bring research IT questions, and get answers and referrals
- The **Research Bazaar** (ResBaz), , a 3-day research festival to teach skills and help people build local communities (run in 10 cities worldwide in 2016 and in 14 locations in 2017)
- **[SatRdays](https://satrdays.org/)** - weekend-run conferences for people working with R
- **[CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/)** - the key networking and community building event in the Carpentries annual calendar
- **Chatrooms** such as [Gitter](https://gitter.im) and [Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) - - asynchronous ways for communities to meet and share ideas
