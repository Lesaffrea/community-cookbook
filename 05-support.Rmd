# Support Structures

There are many ways to build long-term support for your community of practice into the social fabric of your institution. When the story gets around your campus or organization that there is a community that can help with computational skills, you may be asked how you can support more people. To do so may present an opportunity to translate your community from an informal collection of colleagues into a more formalized support structure at your organization. This chapter lays out stories and ideas about how to approach, or even create various support structures within your organization that can continue to support these efforts.

# Funding Workshops

There are several potential sources of funding available for workshops, whether these be at an institution, or run as some kind of
event tie-in, say, at a conference within a specific discipline.

## Where to start with your own institution

There are several potential sources of workshop funding within your own institution:

- individual schools, departments, or research centers, especially within those disciplines where computational and data skills are 
needed, but are currently lacking, e.g. in humanities, linguistics, social sciences
- research committees
- research-related units, e.g. research office, graduate schools, postgraduate student recruitment, as they may be interested in supporting training
- student associations, e.g. postgraduate student societies or discipline-specific student associations, e.g. [COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/)
- computing societies of all kinds on campus
- e-research computing or digital scholarship units, if they exist at your institution
- libraries

All of the above may be willing to provide funding for a first workshop if you make a good case for it. Use some of the materials in
[this repository](https://github.com/carpentries/commons) to make your case.

## Outside your institution

1. Conferences may be good places to try to obtain funding for a workshop. The conference organisers may be willing to manage
logistics for the workshop, such as finding a venue, sourcing instructors, and handling registration in return for a workshop
sign-up fee that goes to them.

2. Industry is another source of funding. Companies such as Amazon and Microsoft may be willing to fund a workshop as that may drive customers
to their cloud solutions. If you are running a workshop targeted at a specific discipline, then try to find a local industry partner
who might be willing to put up a little money to fund it as long as they can display their logo or banner at the event and on
any advertising, or address the assembled workshop participants either within the workshop or over a sponsored lunch or coffee break.

3. National infrastructure related to e-research support or supercomputing might also be useful places to try.

## Can you run a workshop *without* funding?

You can! The simplest way to do that is to charge a fee to attendees to cver the costs of organising the workshop. This need not be much but
charging has several benefits:

- people who register for a fee are more likely to attend and stay for the whole workshop
- fees may allow you to provide catering which is always popular and helps with retention
- registration fees allow you to cover any costs incurred, such as room hire, instructor travel, the
purchase of workshop necessities such as sticky notes,
whiteboard markers, extension cables and power boards (and possibly wifi/wifi boosters)
- what money is not spent can be saved to help fund later workshops

If you can find a suitable room on campus that can seat 20 or more people at tables, that has good wifi, and is accessible, then
you can run your workshop for little to no money at all.
