# Getting started 

Maybe you're looking to develop your own data driven resarch skills, maybe you're looking for a way to support the overwhelming number of researchers that are coming to you for help. Whatever the case may be, working to intentionally build one or more communities of practice around computational skills can be a very rewarding endevour. It can also be deeply challenging to reach critical-mass where things feel like they come together and work on their own. Like building any communtiy you have to help people understand the possibilities of the collective. To do this we have various strategies contained throughout this document. There are ways to run events like workshops, un-conferences and bazaars that bring people together and nudge them to talk to each other about tools, workflows, opportunities and challenges.

In almost every discipline today, cutting edge research questions require some level of computational skill. From astronomers collectively looking at the gravitational wiggles of thousands of distant stars to digital humanists training document classifiers to "read" with a critical eye, eventually we're all bound to run into technical challanges. How can we support one antoher and develop rich and inviting communities that are virtuous for all participants. A group of novices with little skill coming together can be deeply frustrating feeling something like the blind leading the blind. At the same time experts at your institution are likely tapped-out and overwhelmed with requests for their time or insights. How can we build communities of practice that are beneficial to both ends of this spectrum and raise up everyone's skills and abilities.
